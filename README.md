# Zod Types Demo Project

This project demonstrates using Zod as an alternative to TypeScript for adding types to JavaScript projects.

## Benefits of style shown
* Runtime type checking for enhanced reliability
* Autocompletion support in popular editors (VSCode, Vim)
* Works with vanilla JavaScript - no TypeScript required, no build step
* Published modules retain type information for consumers
* build/install/clean npm targets for project hygine

## Test the code
```
npm i
npm test
```

## Project Implementation Notes
These implementation choices are not core to the Zod demonstration:
* Standard.js coding style is used but is not significant to the demo
* Tape testing framework is used but is not significant to the demo
* package-lock.json is gitignored only to keep repo size small
* Generated TSC files are excluded from source control
